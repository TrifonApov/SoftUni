Clone some of your GitHub repositories two times in different local directories (git clone). Make some
conflicting changes in the both local repositories (e.g. add something at the end of some text file).
Commit the changes in the first local repository (git add .followed by git commit), then push them to GitHub
(git push). Try the same with the second repository. You will need to merge the conflicting changes (git pull),
them commit and push again.
